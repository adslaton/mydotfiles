# How to contribute
* Additions should work on unix based systems.  Nothing specific to a certain
  distribution. (No homebrew, node, etc)
* Create a pull request
* Once someone has commented something along the lines of "approved",
  "looks good", etc, you can then merge it in.  If you do not have access to
  merge it in, then someone that does will do it for you.

Thanks!
